I created my hero (moth) entity and multiple rain drop (enemies) 
which fall down at different speeds. They don't bounce off the ground, 
new raindrops spawn when the raindrop hits the ground. 

I also added animations to the hero. When the moth flies around the game 
window its wings flap making it look real. It also faces the direction its 
moving in. 

I also added a health bar which allows the player to be hit 3
times before the game ends. I also added a win condition (making it under 
a flog umbrella.

I added a GameOver and YouWin screen which allows the player to reset the 
game or quit
